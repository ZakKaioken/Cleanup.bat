# Cleanup.bat

Welcome to Cleanup.bat update 2 (8 months after the first version).

This update brings a whole new script. Site Cleanup.bat is a "revolutionary" new product that everyone will use. i am joking. 

site cleanup has a personality. he will ask you a small variety of questions. 
these being the super smart "where do you want to put the files?"
the beautiful to your feet "when i'm done do you want me to open the install folder?"
and last but definitely not least, daring "uh, what is your name again?"
That's right. he calls you by your name. no script has ever done that before.

after you run it once, he'll know your name forever. also where you like to put the files, and that you like opening the folder.
that is; of course if you don't delete his config.sc file.

user cleanup is in ways more boring than site cleanup. user cleanup doesnt have those nice personality features that you totally desire.

he is considered savage though. he doesnt care if this is an important folder. he will move your stuff and tell you where when he's done.
the only way to customize him is to edit him in a text editor. 

What? you dont know what a text editor is? your on github! the one stop shop for code you may steal for your own projects.
you can either be a nice guy and help people out with their projects, or a not so nice guy who steals code for their own gains.

eitherway, i welcome you. the text editor i would reccomend you to use is called Visual Studio Code.
a very very nice, smooth, cool looking, customizable, lightweight text editor with many really nice development features for all your coding needs.

have a great time with my code. - Zak Kaioken
